PayDay Mod

Hey welcome to my Quake Mod Game featuring some of the aspects of the game PayDay, in this mod you are a character which has to collect coins that monsters are going to drop after defeating them, so you can reach the quota of 1000 coins. To start with you have to open the console and wirte "give all" so you have all the weapons available on your inventory, and with the numbers from 0-9 and F8 you can access all of them, and from there it's just you defeating mobs everywhere. When a mob is defeated, they will drop a coin that you have to pick up in our to collect them. They also drop some bonuses like health packs, and the amount of coins increases too, so if you are lucky, you can even get 50 coins in one shot. If you like, you can even continue with the game while collecting the coins to reach the quota. Just have fun and enjoy the game.

How to install?

When you download this you have to make a new copy of the "quake2.exe", then you open properties and under the "Shortcut" tab where it says "Target" you have to add this following to the end of the text that it is already in there: " +set game mymod" (without the quotation marks)
